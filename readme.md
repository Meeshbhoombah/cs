# Computer Science
Brush up on or learn the necessary CS algorithms, datastructures, and skills that

## Sidenote
If you're finding this project in it's current form then you have stumbled upon
the experimental stage, where I am learning what content works. Therefore, this
repository is not nearly as complete as it can and will be when it has been 
iterated to the MVP.
