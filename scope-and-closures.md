# Scope and Closures
JavaScript = _dynamic_ (_interpreted_) language BUT STILL compiled

### Compiler Theory
Any compiled programming language generally undergoes three steps:
1. Tokenizing/Lexing
2. Parsing
3. Code Generation

### Tokenizing/Lexing
Break up a string of characters into chunks - i.e: _tokens_
- E.g: `var a = 2;` (most likely) = `var, a, =, 2, ;`

### Parsing
