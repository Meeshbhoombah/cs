# Algorithmic Analysis
Branch of CS which studies the performance of algorithms
- Focus on computing resources used:
    + **Space** (memory)
    + **Runtime** (time required to execute)

Difficult to compare two algorithms as a result of:
- Contents of the dataset
    + What the dataset looks like
- Size of the dataset
- Programming Language
- Hardware

## Practical
- Predict the performance of different algos to guide design decisions
