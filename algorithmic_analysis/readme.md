# Algorithmic Analysis
- **Algorithmic Analysis** studies the performance of algorithms
    + Especially:
        * **Space**
        * **Runtime**
- Comparing computer programs is problamatic because of:
    + Hardware
    + Details of the dataset
    + Size of the problem 

## Practical
- Predict the performance of different algos to guide design decisions
