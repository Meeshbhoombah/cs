# Bitwise Operations

## Bitwise Operations
- AND = &
- OR = |
- XOR = ^
- NOT = !
- LEFT SHIFT = <<
    + Shift the binary digits by n, pad 0's on the right
    + Each shift = multiply by 2 (unless overflow)
- RIGHT SHIFT = >>
    + Shift the binary digits by n, pad 0's on the left
    + Each shift = divided by 2 (with round towards negative infinity)
